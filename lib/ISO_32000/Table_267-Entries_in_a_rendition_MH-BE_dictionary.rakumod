Table 267 – Entries in a rendition MH/BE dictionary

=head1 Methods (Entries)

=head2 C [dictionary]
- (Optional) A media criteria dictionary (see Table 268).
The media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other MH/ BE entries described in 13.2.2, “Viability.” The criteria specified by all of its entries is met regardless of whether it is in an MH or a BE dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a BE dictionary is unrecognized by the conforming reader, it does not affect the viability of the object.
