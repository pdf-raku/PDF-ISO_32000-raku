# PDF-ISO_32000-raku

The [PDF 32000-1:2008 1.7 Specification](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf) contains around 380 tables, of which about 280 can be considered data or object definitions.

This module has been used to extract and generate the roles and classes from the PDF
specification for use by PDF::Class.

PDF::Class (at last count) implements roles and classes for about 100 of these objects, most of which
have been derived and/or checked against the roles generated by this module.

This library contains:

- XHTML tables that have been mined from the PDF-32000 1.7 specification.
- JSON data for the tables
- Raku Roles for tables that represent PDF objects:

The roles are named ISO_32000::Table_NNN-Xxxx and contain method stubs and documentation for each entry in the role


## Tables

Data is available for all of the tables in the PDF-32000 1.7 specification:
```
use PDF::ISO_32000;
# Load data about the Document Information dictionary
my %info = PDF::ISO_32000.table: "Table_317-Entries_in_the_document_information_dictionary";
# -OR- by table number
%info = PDF::ISO_32000.[317];
say %info<caption>;             # Table 317 – Entries in the document information dictionary
say %info<head>.join(" | ");    # Key | Type | Value
say %info<rows>[0].join(" | "); # Title | text string | (Optional; PDF 1.1) The document’s title.
```

The `table-index` method returns a list that maps table numbers to table names:

```
say PDF::ISO_32000.table-index[317] # Table 317 - Info_entries
```

The `appendix` method returns a hash index into the Appendix:

```
my $stream-ops = PDF::ISO_32000.appendix<A.1>;
say $stream-ops, # PDF_content_stream_operators
say PDF::ISO_32000.table($stream-ops)<caption>; #  Table A.1 – PDF content stream operators
```

## Roles

Roles are available for tables named `*_entries`, or `*_attributes`.

```
% p6doc ISO_320000:Table_317-Entries_in_the_document_information_dictionary
% p6doc ISO_320000:Table_28-Entries_in_the_catalog_dictionary
```

The roles also contain [method stubs](https://docs.raku.org/language/objects#Stubs) for the entries that need to be implemented for the role. For example:

```
% cat << EOF > lib/Catalog.rakumod
use ISO_32000::Table_28-Entries_in_the_catalog_dictionary;
unit class Catalog does ISO_32000::Table_28-Entries_in_the_catalog_dictionary;
EOF
% raku -I . -M Catalog
===SORRY!=== Error while compiling lib/Catalog.rakumod (Catalog)
Method 'SpiderInfo' must be implemented by Catalog because it is required by roles: ISO_32000::Table_28-Entries_in_the_catalog_dictionary.
at lib/Catalog.rakumod (Catalog):1
```
This module contains:

- a copy of the [PDF-32000 specification](https://github.com/pdf-raku/PDF-ISO_32000-raku/blob/master/src/PDF32000_2008.pdf)
- [JSON tables](https://github.com/pdf-raku/PDF-ISO_32000-raku/blob/master/resources/) extracted from the above
- [generated interface roles](https://github.com/pdf-raku/PDF-ISO_32000-raku/blob/master/gen/lib/ISO_32000) for building and validating PDF objects
- scripts and Makefiles for regenerating the XML tables and roles

### Releasing this module

This module needs to have its version incremented manually. It is then built via `make`. `make dist` is used to build a tar-ball, which
is then released via `fez`. For example:

```
$ vi lib/PDF/ISO_32000.rakumod # update version number
$ make
$ make test
$ make dist
$ fez upload PDF-ISO_32000-9.9.99.tar.gz # upload this version
```

## ISO 3200 Roles

The following interface roles have been mined from the ISO-32000 specification
