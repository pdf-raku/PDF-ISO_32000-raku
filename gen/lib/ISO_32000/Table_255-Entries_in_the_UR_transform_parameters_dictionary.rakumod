=head1 Description

Table 255 â€“ Entries in the UR transform parameters dictionary

=head1 Methods (Entries)

=head2 Type [name]
- (Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, is TransformParams for a transform parameters dictionary.

=head2 Document [array]
- (Optional) An array of names specifying additional document-wide usage rights for the document. The only defined value is FullSave, which permits a user to save the document along with modified form and/or annotation data. (PDF 1.5) Any usage right that permits the document to be modified implicitly enables the FullSave right.
If the PDF document contains a UR3 dictionary, only rights specified by the Annots entry that permit the document to be modified shall implicitly enable the FullSave right. For all other rights, FullSave is explicitly enabled in order to save the document. (Signature rights permits saving as part of the signing process but not otherwise).
If the P entry in the UR transform parameters dictionary is true (PDF 1.6) and greater conforming readers permits only those rights that are enabled by the entries in the dictionary. However, conforming readers permits saving the document as long as any rights that permit modifying the document are enabled.

=head2 Msg [text string]
- (Optional) A text string that may be used to specify any arbitrary information, such as the reason for adding usage rights to the document.

=head2 V [name]
- (Optional) The UR transform parameters dictionary version. The value is 2.2. If an unknown version is present, no rights is enabled.
NOTE This value is a name object, not a number. Default value: 2.2.

=head2 Annots [array]
- (Optional) An array of names specifying additional annotation-related usage rights for the document. Valid names (PDF 1.5) are Create, Delete, Modify, Copy, Import, and Export, which permits the user to perform the named operation on annotations.
The following names (PDF 1.6) is permitted only when the signature dictionary is referenced from the UR3 entry of the permissions dictionary (see Table 258):

=head2 Signature [array]
- (Optional) An array of names specifying additional signature-related usage rights for the document. The only defined value is Modify, which permits a user to apply a digital signature to an existing signature form field or clear a signed signature form field.
