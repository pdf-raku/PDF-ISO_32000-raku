It provides additional information about the colour specified by DeviceColorant—in particular, the alternate colour space and tint transformation function that is used to represent the colorant as a process colour. This information enables a conforming reader to preview the separation in a colour that approximates the device colorant.\nThe value of DeviceColorant matches the space’s colorant name (if it is a Separation space) or be one of the space’s colorant names (if it is a DeviceN space)."
