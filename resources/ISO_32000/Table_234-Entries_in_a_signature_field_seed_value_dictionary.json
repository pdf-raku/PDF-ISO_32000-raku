Beginning with PDF 1.7, if Filter is specified and the Ff entry indicates this entry is a required constraint, then the signature handler specified by this entry is used when signing; otherwise, signing does not take place.

The values 1 through 3 is used for certification signatures and correspond to the value of P in a DocMDP transform parameters dictionary (see Table 254).\nIf this MDP key is not present or the MDP dictionary does not contain a P entry, no rules is defined regarding the type of signature or its permissions."

If AddRevInfo is true, the conforming processor performs the following additional tasks when signing the signature field:\nPerform revocation checking of the certificate (and the corresponding issuing certificates) used to sign.\nInclude the revocation information within the signature value.\nThree SubFilter values have been defined for ISO 32000. For those values the AddRevInfo value is true only if SubFilter is adbe.pkcs7.detached or adbe.pkcs7.sha1. If SubFilter is x509.rsa_sha1, this entry is omitted or set to false. Additional SubFilters may be defined that also use AddRevInfo values.\nIf AddRevInfo is true and the Ff entry indicates this is a required constraint, then the preceding tasks is performed. If they cannot be performed, then signing fails.\nDefault value: false\nNOTE 1 Revocation information is carried in the signature data as specified by PCKS7. See 12.8.3.3, \"PKCS7 Signatures as used in ISO 32000\".\nNOTE 2 The trust anchors used are determined by the signature handlers for both creation and validation."
