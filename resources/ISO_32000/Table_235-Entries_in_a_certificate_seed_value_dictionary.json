The certificate ultimately used for the digital signature contains all the attributes specified in each of the dictionaries in this array. (PDF keys and values are mapped to certificate attributes and values.) The certificate is not constrained to use only attribute entries from these dictionaries but may contain additional attributes.The Subject Distinguished Name is described in RFC 3280 (see the Bibliography). The key can be any legal attribute identifier (OID). Attribute names contains characters in the set a-z A-Z 0-9 and PERIOD.\nCertificate attribute names are used as key names in the dictionaries in this array. Values of the attributes are used as values of the keys. Values is text strings.\nThe value of the corresponding flag in the Ff entry indicates whether this entry is a required constraint."

Multiple strings specify a range of acceptable key- usage extensions. The key-usage extension is described in RFC 3280.\nEach character in a string represents a key-usage type, where the order of the characters indicates the key-usage extension it represents. The first through ninth characters in the string, from left to right, represent the required value for the following key-usage extensions:\n1 digitalSignature 4 dataEncipherment 7 cRLSign\n2 non-Repudiation 5 keyAgreement 8 encipherOnly\n3 keyEncipherment 6 keyCertSign 9 decipherOnly\nAny additional characters is ignored. Any missing characters or characters that are not one of the following values, is treated as ‘X’. The following character values is supported:\n0 Corresponding key-usage is not set.\n1 Corresponding key-usage is set.\nX State of the corresponding key-usage does not matter.\nEXAMPLE 1 The string values ‘1’ and ‘1XXXXXXXX’ represent settings where the key-usage type digitalSignature is set and the state of all other key-usage types do not matter.
