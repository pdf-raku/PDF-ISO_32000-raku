If ImageMask is true, this entry is optional, but if specified, its value is 1.\nIf the image stream uses a filter, the value of BitsPerComponent is consistent with the size of the data samples that the filter delivers. In particular, a CCITTFaxDecode or JBIG2Decode filter always deliver 1-bit samples, a RunLengthDecode or DCTDecode filter always deliver 8-bit samples, and an LZWDecode or FlateDecode filter delivers samples of a specified size if a predictor function is used.\nIf the image stream uses the JPXDecode filter, this entry is optional and is ignored if present. The bit depth is determined by the conforming reader in the process of decoding the JPEG2000 image."

The alpha source parameter in the graphics state determines whether the mask values is interpreted as shape or opacity.\nIf present, this entry overrides the current soft mask in the graphics state, as well as the image’s Mask entry, if any. However, the other transparency-related graphics state parameters—blend mode and alpha constant—remains in effect. If SMask is absent, the image has no associated soft mask (although the current soft mask in the graphics state may still apply)."

A conforming reader may create a soft-mask image from the information to be used as a source of mask shape or mask opacity in the transparency imaging model.\n2 The image’s data stream includes colour channels that have been preblended with a background; the image data also includes an opacity channel. A conforming reader may create a soft-mask image with a Matte entry from the opacity channel information to be used as a source of mask shape or mask opacity in the transparency model.\nIf this entry has a nonzero value, SMask is not specified.
