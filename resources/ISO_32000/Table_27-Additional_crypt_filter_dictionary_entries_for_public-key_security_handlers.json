The enveloped data contained in the PKCS7 object includes both a 20-byte seed value that is used to compute the encryption key (see 7.6.4.3, \"Public-Key Encryption Algorithms\") followed by 4 bytes of permissions settings (see Table 22) that applies to the recipient list. There is only one object per unique set of access permissions. If a recipient appears in more than one list, the permissions used is those in the first matching list.\nIf the crypt filter is referenced from a Crypt filter decode parameter dictionary (see Table 14), this entry is a string that is a binary-encoded PKCS7 object contains a list of all recipients who are permitted to access the corresponding encrypted stream. The enveloped data contained in the PKCS7 object is a 20-byte seed value that is used to create the encryption key that is used by the algorithm in \"Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES algorithms\"."
