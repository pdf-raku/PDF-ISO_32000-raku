If it is a number, the operator adjusts the text position by that amount; that is, it translates the text matrix, Tm . The number is expressed in thousandths of a unit of text space (see 9.4.4, \"Text Space Details\"). This amount is subtracted from the current horizontal or vertical coordinate, depending on the writing mode. In the default coordinate system, a positive adjustment has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the left or down by the given amount. Figure 46 shows an example of the effect of passing offsets to TJ."
