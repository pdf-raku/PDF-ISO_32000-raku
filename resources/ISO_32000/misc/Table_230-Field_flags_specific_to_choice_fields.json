        "(PDF 1.5) If set, the new value is committed as soon as a selection is made (commonly with the pointing device). In this case, supplying a value for a field involves three actions: selecting the field for fill-in, selecting a choice for the fill-in value, and leaving that field, which finalizes or “commits” the data choice and triggers any actions associated with the entry or changing of this data. If this flag is on, then processing does not wait for leaving the field action to occur, but immediately proceeds to the third step.\nThis option enables applications to perform an action once a selection is made, without requiring the user to exit the field. If clear, the new value is not committed until the user exits the field."
