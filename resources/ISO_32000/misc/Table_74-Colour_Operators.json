        "(PDF 1.1) Set the current colour space to use for stroking operations. The operand name is a name object. If the colour space is one that can be specified by a name and no additional parameters (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and certain cases of Pattern), the name may be specified directly. Otherwise, it is a name defined in the ColorSpace subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, \"Resource Dictionaries\"); the associated value is an array describing the colour space (see 8.6.3, \"Colour Space Families\").\nThe names DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and Pattern always identify the corresponding colour spaces directly; they never refer to resources in the ColorSpace subdictionary.\nThe CS operator shall also set the current stroking colour to its initial value, which depends on the colour space:\nIn a DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, CalGray, or CalRGB colour space, the initial colour has all components equal to 0.0.\nIn a DeviceCMYK colour space, the initial colour is [ 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 ].\nIn a Lab or ICCBased colour space, the initial colour has all components equal to 0.0 unless that falls outside the intervals specified by the space’s Range entry, in which case the nearest valid value is substituted.\nIn an Indexed colour space, the initial colour value is 0.\nIn a Separation or DeviceN colour space, the initial tint value is 1.0 for all colorants.\nIn a Pattern colour space, the initial colour is a pattern object that causes nothing to be painted."
