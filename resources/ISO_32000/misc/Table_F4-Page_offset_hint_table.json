The location of the first object of the first page may be determined from its object number (the O entry in the linearization parameter dictionary) and the cross- reference table entry for that object; see F.3.4, \"First-Page Cross- Reference Table and Trailer (Part 3)\". The locations of subsequent pages is determined by accumulating the lengths of all previous pages. A conforming product skips over the primary hint stream, wherever it is located."

A single entry in the shared object hint table may designate a group of shared objects, but only one of which is referenced from outside the group. That is, shared object identifiers is not directly related to object numbers.\nThis identifier combines with the numerators provided in item 5 to form a shared object reference."

        "(One item for each shared object referenced from the page) The numerator of the fractional position for each shared object reference, which is in the same order as the preceding item. The fraction indicates where in the page’s content stream the shared object is first referenced. This item is interpreted as the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is specified once for the entire document (Table F.3, item 13).\nEXAMPLE If the denominator is d, a numerator ranging from 0 to d - 1 indicates the corresponding portion of the page’s content stream. For example, if the denominator is 4, a numerator of 0, 1, 2, or 3 indicates that the first reference lies in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the content stream, respectively. There are two (or more) other possible values for the numerator, which indicates that the shared object is not referenced from the content stream but instead is needed by annotations or other objects that are drawn after the contents. The value d indicates that the shared object is needed before image XObjects and other nonshared objects that are at the end of the page. A value of d + 1 or greater indicates that the shared object is needed after those objects.\nNOTE This method of dividing the page into fractions is only approximate. Determining the first reference to a shared object entails inspecting the unencoded content stream. The relationship between positions in the unencoded and encoded streams is not necessarily linear."
