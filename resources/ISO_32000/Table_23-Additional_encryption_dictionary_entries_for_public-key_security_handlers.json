The data contained in the PKCS7 object includes both a cryptographic key that is used to decrypt the encrypted data and the access permissions (see Table 24) that apply to the recipient list. There is only one PKCS7 object per unique set of access permissions; if a recipient appears in more than one list, the permissions used is those in the first matching list.\nWhen SubFilter is adbe.pkcs7.s5, recipient lists is specified in the crypt filter dictionary; see Table 27."
