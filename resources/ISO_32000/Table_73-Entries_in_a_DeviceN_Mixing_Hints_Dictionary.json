        "(Optional) A dictionary specifying the solidity of inks that is used in blending calculations when used as an alternative to the tint transformation function. For each entry, the key is a colorant name, and the value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This dictionary need not contain entries for all colorants used in this colour space; it may also include additional colorants not used by this colour space.\nA value of 1.0 simulates an ink that completely covers the inks beneath; a value of 0.0 simulates a transparent ink that completely reveals the inks beneath. An entry with a key of Default specifies a value that is used by all components in the associated DeviceN colour space for which a solidity value is not explicitly provided. If Default is not present, the default value for unspecified colorants is 0.0; conforming readers may choose to use other values.\nIf this entry is present, PrintingOrder is also present."

Dot gain (or loss) represents the amount by which a printer’s halftone dots change as the ink spreads and is absorbed by paper.\nFor each entry, the key is a colorant name, and the value is a function that maps values in the range 0 to 1 to values in the range 0 to 1. The dictionary may list colorants unused by this specific DeviceNinstance and need not list all colorants. An entry with a key of Defaultshall specify a function to be used by all colorants for which a dot gain function is not explicitly specified.\nConforming readers may ignore values in this dictionary when other sources of dot gain information are available, such as ICC profiles associated with the process colour space or tint transformation functions associated with individual colorants."
