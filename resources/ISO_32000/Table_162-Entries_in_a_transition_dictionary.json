The lines may be either horizontal or vertical and may move inward from the edges of the page or outward from the center, as specified by the Dm and M entries, respectively.\nBlinds Multiple lines, evenly spaced across the screen, synchronously sweep in the same direction to reveal the new page. The lines may be either horizontal or vertical, as specified by the Dm entry. Horizontal lines move downward; vertical lines move to the right.\nBox A rectangular box sweeps inward from the edges of the page or outward from the center, as specified by the M entry, revealing the new page.\nWipe A single line sweeps across the screen from one edge to the other in the direction specified by the Di entry, revealing the new page.\nDissolve The old page dissolves gradually to reveal the new one.\nGlitter Similar to Dissolve, except that the effect sweeps across the page in a wide band moving from one side of the screen to the other in the direction specified by the Di entry.\nR The new page simply replaces the old one with no special transition effect; the D entry is ignored.\nFly(PDF 1.5) Changes are flown out or in (as specified by M), in the direction specified by Di, to or from a location that is offscreen except when Di is None."
