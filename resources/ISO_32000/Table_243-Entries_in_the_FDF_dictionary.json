        "(Optional; PDF 1.4) A stream containing all the bytes in all incremental updates made to the underlying PDF document since it was opened (see 7.5.6, “Incremental Updates”). If a submit-form action submitting the document to a remote server as FDF has its IncludeAppendSaves flag set (see 12.7.5.2, “Submit-Form Action”), the contents of this stream is included in the submission. This allows any digital signatures (see 12.8, “Digital Signatures”) to be transmitted to the server. An incremental update is automatically performed just before the submission takes place, in order to capture all changes made to the document.\nThe submission includes the full set of incremental updates back to the time the document was first opened, even if some of them may already have been included in intervening submissions. Although a Fields or Annots entry (or both) may be present along with Differences, there is no requirement that their contents will be consistent with each other. In particular, if Differences contains a digital signature, only the values of the form fields given in the Differences stream is considered trustworthy under that signature."
