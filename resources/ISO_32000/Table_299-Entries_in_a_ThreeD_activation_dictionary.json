Default value: XA.\nNOTE 2 For performance reasons, documents intended for viewing in a web browser uses explicit activation (XA). In non- interactive applications, such as printing systems or aggregating conforming reader, PO and PV indicate that the annotation is activated when the page is printed or placed; XA indicates that the annotation never be activated and the normal appearance is used."
