It is within the rectangle specified by the annotation’s Rect entry and is expressed in the annotation’s target coordinate system (see discussion following this Table).\nDefault value: the annotation’s Rect entry, expressed in the target coordinate system. This value is [ -w/2 -h/2 w/2 h/2 ], where w and h are the width and height, respectively, of Rect."
