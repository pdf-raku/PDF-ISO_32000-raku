        "(Optional) A media criteria dictionary (see Table 268).\nThe media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other MH/ BE entries described in 13.2.2, “Viability.” The criteria specified by all of its entries is met regardless of whether it is in an MH or a BE dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a BE dictionary is unrecognized by the conforming reader, it does not affect the viability of the object."
