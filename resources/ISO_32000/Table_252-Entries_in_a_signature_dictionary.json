If the Prop_Build entry is not present, it is also the name of the signature handler that was used to create the signature. If Prop_Build is present, it may be used to determine the name of the handler that created the signature (which is typically the same as Filter but is not needed to be). A conforming reader may substitute a different handler when verifying the signature, as long as it supports the specified SubFilter format. Example signature handlers are Adobe.PPKLite, Entrust.PPKEF, CICI.SignIt, and VeriSign.PPKVS. The name of the filter (i.e. signature handler) is identified in accordance with the rules defined in Annex E."

Other values may be defined by developers, and when used, is prefixed with the registered developer identification. All prefix names is registered (see Annex E). The prefix “adbe” has been registered by Adobe Systems and the three subfilter names listed above and defined in 12.8.3, “Signature Interoperability“ may be used by any developer."

The signing certificate appears first in the array; it is used to verify the signature value in Contents, and the other certificates is used to verify the authenticity of the signing certificate.\nIf SubFilter is adbe.pkcs7.detached or adbe.pkcs7.sha1, this entry is not used, and the certificate chain is put in the PKCS7 envelope in Contents."
