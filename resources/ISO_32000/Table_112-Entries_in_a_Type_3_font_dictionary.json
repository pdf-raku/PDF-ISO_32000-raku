This is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that would result if all of the glyphs of the font were placed with their origins coincident and then filled.\nIf all four elements of the rectangle are zero, a conforming reader makes no assumptions about glyph sizes based on the font bounding box. If any element is nonzero, the font bounding box is accurate. If any glyph’s marks fall outside this bounding box, incorrect behavior may result."

For character codes outside the range FirstChar to LastChar, the width is 0. These widths is interpreted in glyph space as specified by FontMatrix (unlike the widths of a Type 1 font, which are in thousandths of a unit of text space).\nIf FontMatrix specifies a rotation, only the horizontal component of the transformed width is used. That is, the resulting displacement is horizontal in text space, as is the case for all simple fonts."
