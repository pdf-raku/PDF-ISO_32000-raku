        "FOV",
        "number",
        "(Required if Subtype is P, ignored otherwise) A number between 0 and 180, inclusive, specifying the field of view of the virtual camera, in degrees. It defines a cone in 3D space centered around the z axis and a circle where the cone intersects the near clipping plane. The circle, along with the value of PS, specify the scaling of the projected artwork when rendered in the 2D plane of the annotation."

It defines the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection of the near plane and the cone specified by FOV. The value may be one of the following:\n• A positive number that explicitly specifies the diameter as a distance in the annotation’s target coordinate system.\n• A name specifying that the diameter is set to the width (W), height (H), minimum of width and height (Min), or maximum of width and height (Max) of the annotation’s 3D view box.

        "OB",

        "(Optional; PDF 1.7; meaningful only if Subtype is O) A name that specifies a strategy for binding (scaling to fit) the near plane’s x and y coordinates onto the annotation’s target coordinate system. The scaling specified in this entry is applied in addition to the scaling factor specified by the OS entry. The value may be one of the following:\nW Scale to fit the width of the annotation\nHScale to fit the height of the annotation\nMinScale to fit the lesser of width or height of the annotation\nMaxScale to fit the greater of width or height of the annotation\nAbsolute No scaling occurs due to binding.\nDefault value: Absolute."
